# Finite-speed-of-Gravity
Coherent simulation of a finite propagation speed of gravity.


Use Fortran package Manager to compile the program. 

You can modify the number of particles, initial condidion and masses, lokking insie of the code, and repositorie. 

The program will print, energy, orbits, distances, error funciotns.
